# Project nAI

## Introduction
Welcome to Project nAI! Our mission is to bridge the gap between closed-source models using prompts and open-source models, facilitating their educational use. We curate a collection of effective prompts and fine-tuned models in a single platform. Contributors are encouraged to add models via JSON configuration. Currently, we feature prompts for Bison, Gemini, and GPT models, with plans for continuous expansion(Claude, Llama etc.). Please note that the project is in its early stages, leveraging Vite for a basic UI, ensuring it can be easily run locally by anyone interested.

## About
Project nAI started with the goal of exploring and integrating fine-tuned versions of Gemini, GPT, and open-source models, fostering experimentation and learning within the AI community. Our platform supports developers and researchers in testing these models, promoting transparency, and fostering collaboration.

## Features
- Integration of closed-source models using prompts.
- Inclusion of fine-tuned models suitable for specific tasks (e.g., Gemini's fine-tuned variants).
- Open JSON configuration for adding new models.
- Basic UI built with Vite for easy local deployment and testing.

## Get Involved
We welcome contributions from developers, researchers, and enthusiasts alike. Whether you're interested in adding new models, fine-tuning existing ones, improving UI/UX features, or contributing in other ways, your participation is valued at Project nAI.
